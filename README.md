# Introduction to debugging in Python

Welcome to the introduction to debugging in Python. 
This course does not require any prior knowledge of debugging, but it does require a basic knowledge of Python.

Since we will be using GitHub and GitHub Skills templates, I strongly suggest completing two GitHub skills courses:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- [Code with Codespace](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) (the first 3 steps are enough for this course)


### Course format
The entire course will have 3 parts or steps, each step will have multiple sections that will require reading short text or specific section from the external sources, watching a short video or practicing your knowledge in hands-on activities.
Every step should take no more than 1--2, hours and significantly less if you have prior experience.

#### Part 1
- what are the Python errors and exceptions?
- how to read Python traceback?

#### Part 2
- what is debugging?
- debugging tools and methods

#### Part 3
- introduction to debugging with `pdb`


## How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'Science-Reproducibility',
  template_name: 'python-debugging',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'python-debugging',
  description: 'My fork of the repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
